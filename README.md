# Loan Approval Prediction System

This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant details such as income, credit history, and employment status.  
It demonstrates the use of **Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Machine Learning algorithms** for solving real-world financial decision-making problems.
